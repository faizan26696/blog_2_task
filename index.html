                    <p>
                        Variables are one of the important theories in programming. It could even be said to be the most
                        important. They are part of the fundamentals of any programming language. Without them, it would
                        be
                        difficult to perform manipulation, and computations. We would have no way of storing
                        information,
                        retrieving them and no track of values. <br>

                        A variable is a storage location or a memory location that holds a data type and values.
                        JavaScript
                        variables are variables declared and assigned in JavaScript,
                        that
                        holds
                        values and datatypes.
                        In this article, we will look at variables in JavaScript, the datatypes they hold, good naming
                        and
                        writing practices, how they are implemented and manipulated and their scope.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
        <p>
            You need to identify JavaScript variables with unique names. These unique names are called
            identifiers. You can provide short names or descriptive names for your identifier. Some rules
            you must keep in mind while naming JavaScript Identifiers are:
        </p>
        <div class="rules">
            <ul>
                <li>Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.</li>
                <li>Names must begin with a letter.</li>
                <li>The identifier names can also begin with $ and _.</li>
                <li>Names are case sensitive. Thus, y and Y are different variables.</li>
                <li>Reserved words cannot be used as names.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Variables types</h2>
            <div class="list">
                <h3>Var</h3>
                <p>
                    Before 2015 (ES6 release of JavaScript), var was the only keyword used in defining variables. It had
                    some issues, one of it being that variables existed even outside the scope in which they were
                    defined. So let and const were introduced to make up for the shortcomings of var.
                </p>

                <h3>Let</h3>
                <p>
                    Let is one of the keywords released in ES6. It is a better option to use var. It allows variables to
                    be updated, only within the block in which it is initialized. Let declarations are hoisted to the
                    top.
                </p>

                <h3>Const</h3>
                <p>
                    Const, just like let was introduced in 2015. It differs slightly from let and var. It is strict and
                    used for variables whose values are constant and will not change during the execution of the
                    program. These variables cannot be reassigned or updated.

                    JavaScript variables Assigning
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Assigning a value to a variable means using the assignment operator (=) or any other assignment
                    operator (which we will look at later on) to apportion a value to a memory location.
                    A variable is declared when it is created. In JavaScript, variables are declared using any of these
                    three
                    keywords - var, let and const.
                    The code below creates/defines 3 variables a, b and c <br> which have for values 2, 4 and 6
                    respectively.

            <h2>The Data types of variable</h2>
            <p>
                We've seen that variables have a name, a value and that we can use keywords to define it. Variables also
                got a type.

                The type is a way to regroup similar variables and take actions on those without really knowing what are
                their values when we write code.

                For example, if I have two variables of the same type "integar", I know I can add it even though I don't
                know the exact value which will be stocked.

                There are several types of variables in JavaScript. In the example of the 3 a, b and c variables we
                already talked about, each variable stocks a number. So the type is Number.

                Variables can be one of the following types:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="variable-data-types">
            <div class="list-var">
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="type-text"> String </span> :A string of characters (± text)</li>
                    <li><span class="type-text"> Boolean </span> : A variable that can hold only 2 values: true or
                        false.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="type-text"> Array </span>: A value table.</li>
                    <li><span class="type-text"> Object </span>: An object.</li>
                    <li><span class="type-text"> Number </span>: A number. It can be integar, positive, negative,
                        decimal.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="type-text"> Symbol </span>: A unique data that can't be changed.</li>
                    <li><span class="type-text">undefined</span>:A variable that has not been assigned a value</li>
                    <li><span class="type-text">Bigint</span> :a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent
                        integers with
                        arbitrary magnitude</li>
                    <li><span class="type-text">Null</span> :represents the intentional absence of any object value</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="data-type-image">
                <img src="data-type2.jpg">
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="access-var">
        <h2>How access value of a variable?</h2>
        <p>
            In JavaScript, you can access the value of a variable by simply referencing its name in your code. For
            example, if you have a variable named x with a value of 10, you can access its value by using the variable
            name x in an expression or by printing it using console.log
        </p>
        <span class="example">
            <p>
                let x = 10;
                <br>
                console.log(x); // <span style="background: yellow;">Output: 10</span>
            </p>
        </span>
    </div>

    <div class="last-example">
        <h2>What will happen if we try to access the variable that doesn’t exist?
        </h2>
        <p>
            If we try to access a variable that doesn't exist in your code, it will raise a NameError exception. For
            example:
            <br>
            <span class="example-2">
                <p class="exp-2"> print(y) # Output: NameError: name 'y' is not defined</p>
            </span>
            <br>
            This means that the variable y has not been defined or assigned a value in your code. To avoid this error,
            make sure that you have defined and assigned a value to a variable before trying to access it.
        </p>
